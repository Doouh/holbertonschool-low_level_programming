# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings
In this project we work pointers, arrays and strings; We did exercises in which it was necessary to correctly access the assigned memory addresses to obtain the requested results. In addition, the first [crackme](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x04.c), file that was unlocked by finding the correct password. **Requirement:** You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc… is forbidden.
## Task Index
|File name              |Description                         |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
|[0-reset_to_98.c](https://github.com/Doouh/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/0-reset_to_98.c)|Function that takes a pointer to an `int` as parameter and updates the value it points to to `98`.<br>- Prototype: `void reset_to_98(int *n);`|
|[1-swap.c](https://github.com/Doouh/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/1-swap.c)|Function that swaps the values of two integers.<br>- Prototype: `void swap_int(int *a, int *b);`|
|[2-strlen.c](https://github.com/Doouh/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/2-strlen.c)|Function that returns the length of a string.<br>- Prototype: `int _strlen(char *s);`|
|[3-puts.c](https://github.com/Doouh/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/3-puts.c)|Function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to `stdout`.<br>- Prototype: `void _puts(char *str);`|
|[4-print_rev.c](https://github.com/Doouh/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/4-print_rev.c)|Function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.<br>- Prototype: `void print_rev(char *s);`|
|[5-rev_string.c](https://github.com/Doouh/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/5-rev_string.c)|Function that reverses a string.<br>- Prototype: `void rev_string(char *s);`|
|[6-puts2.c](https://github.com/Doouh/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/6-puts2.c)|Function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.<br>- Prototype: `void puts2(char *str);`|
|[7-puts_half.c](https://github.com/Doouh/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/7-puts_half.c)|Function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.<br>- Prototype: `void puts_half(char *str);`<br>- The function should print the second half of the string.<br>- If the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last `n` characters of the string, where `n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2`.|
|[8-print_array.c](https://github.com/Doouh/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/8-print_array.c)|Function that prints `n` elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.<br>- Prototype: `void print_array(int *a, int n);`<br>- Where `n` is the number of elements of the array to be printed.<br>- Numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space.<br>- The numbers should be displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array.<br>- You are allowed to use `printf`.|
|[9-strcpy.c](https://github.com/Doouh/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/9-strcpy.c)|Function that copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte (`\0`), to the buffer pointed to by `dest`.<br>- Prototype: `char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);`<br>- Return value: the pointer to `dest`.|
|**Advanced Tasks**||
|[100-atoi.c](https://github.com/Doouh/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/100-atoi.c)|Function that convert a string to an integer.<br>- Prototype: `int _atoi(char *s);`<br>- The number in the string can be preceded by an infinite number of characters.<br>- You need to take into account all the `-` and `+` signs before the number.<br>- If there are no numbers in the string, the function must return `0`.<br>- You are not allowed to use `long`.<br>- You are not allowed to declare new variables of “type” array.<br>- You are not allowed to hard-code special values.|
|[101-keygen.c](https://github.com/Doouh/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/101-keygen.c)|Program that generates random valid passwords for the program [crackme](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x04.c).<br>- You are allowed to use the standard library.|

**At the end of the day, all the tasks and their proposed requirements were satisfactorily fulfilled.**
