# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops
In this project we work functions, and nested loops; again with the correct printing of texts and figures with characters.
**Requeriment:** You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etcâ€¦ is forbidden.

|[7-print_diagonal.c](https://github.com/Doouh/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/7-print_diagonal.c)|Function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.<br>- Prototype: `void print_diagonal(int n);`<br>- You can only use `_putchar` function to print.<br>- Where `n` is the number of times the character `\` should be printed.<br>- The diagonal should end with a `\n`.<br>- If `n` is `0` or less, the function should only print a `\n`.|
|[8-print_square.c](https://github.com/Doouh/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/8-print_square.c)|Function that prints a square, followed by a new line.<br>- Prototype: `void print_square(int size);`<br>- You can only use `_putchar` function to print.<br>- Where `size` is the size of the square.<br>- If `size` is `0` or less, the function should print only a new line.<br>- Use the character `#` to print the square.|
|[9-fizz_buzz.c](https://github.com/Doouh/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/9-fizz_buzz.c)|Program that prints the numbers from `1` to `100`, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`.<br>- Each number or word should be separated by a space.<br>- You are allowed to use the standard library.|
