# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
In this project we work functions, and nested loops; again with the correct printing of texts and the mathematical operation with very large numbers.
**Requeriment:** You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc… is forbidden.
